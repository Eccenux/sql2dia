This software is in early stages, many things needs to be made.
For now it only generates a "class" diagram with one class for each
table in the database, and all columns as "class attributes".

Next steps are:
- Create relation lines between tables
- Reorder tables based on relations
- Use a better way to generate the XML (maybe the Dia libs, needs study)
- Support for PostgreSQL

For more information about the GPL, see the COPYING file.

THANKS TO:
Ken Gilmer - for his patch to support database authentication.

NOTE:
I have no direct connection with the Dia developers.
I'm only a fan of their work.
